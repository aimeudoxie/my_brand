            How I Rewrote My Blog with Next.js

                I wrote the previous version of my blog with Gatsby.js and MDX for custom components in article posts.

I have had my blog for almost one year, and I decided to rewrite everything with Next.js. I stopped working with Gatsby.js after one problem with og:images. Yes, I decided to abandon Gatsby.js only because of one thing.

I don’t remember what exactly was going on and why the problem occurred. Because of this, all my love for Gatsby ended - I had to rewrite the entire landing page for our client.

On my new blog, I decided to change colors a little bit. You can compare my previous website with the current one.
Hello, Next.js!
I have been working with Next.js since version 6 (released 16th May 2018), and currently, it's my default React framework. A few months ago, I had a project with Create-React-App, which was a nightmare. I'm not an anti-CRA. I didn't use CRA for a long time and forgot how to use it. For me, the Next router is much more intuitive than React default routing.

I love how Next.js handles server-side rendering. I wrote the entire app with the backend inside Next. It might not be wise to do it, but this app is only for me, so I don’t have to worry about security and all this stuff. I’m not a backend developer. My backend knowledge is limited to the basics of Node and Python.
The Design
It’s hard to design anything if you are 100% technical and 0% creative. I can’t even draw a circle or 4 x 90deg square by myself. I could use some help from designers from our company, but I didn't want to wait until they were free. So I decided to do it independently, like the previous design.

First of all, I planned what I wanted to have on every blog page. I used Notion to jot down all the ideas, and after a few days of thinking, I started to do some research. I spent several hours on Dribbble to get inspired and find all the best solutions for my new blog. Then, I began to do some basic designs in Figma.
I have planned and designed more sections, but this will have to do for a start.

I had some feedback and design consultation from Diana and her help in designing the first section on the homepage.
